# MC++ Toolkit for Construction, Manipulation and Evaluation of Factorable Functions #

MC++ provides a collection of classes to support the construction and manipulation of factorable functions and their evaluation using a range of arithmetics. It is primarily written in C++ to promote execution speed, while the module pyMC includes Python binders through [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Expression trees in MC++ can comprise any finite combination of unary and binary operations from a default library. MC++ also features a mechanism to extend expression trees with external operations, currently including affine and polynomial subexpressions as well as multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Through the library [CRONOS](https://github.com/omega-icl/cronos), MC++ can also be extended with systems of algebraic and differential equations. Expression trees generated with MC++ can be used by the library [CANON](https://github.com/omega-icl/canon) for local and global numerical optimization; and the library [MAGNUS](https://github.com/omega-icl/magnus) for the development and analysis of mathematical models.

The present version 4.0 of MC++ has capability for:

* Construction and differentiation of expression trees (both forward and reverse accumulation modes)
* Recursive decomposition of factorable expressions into linear/polynomial subexpressions and transcendental operations
* Elimination of variables in factorable expressions
* Decomposition of sparse polynomial expressions into quadratic forms
* Detection of reduction constraints in sparse polynomial expressions

The main bounding components in version 4.0 of MC++ include:

* Interval arithmetic
* Eigenvalue arithmetic
* Ellipsoidal arithmetic
* McCormick relaxations
* Taylor and Chebyshev models
* Polyhedral relaxations
* Superposition relaxations

A range of python notebooks are provided in `src/pymc` to illustrate these capabilities.
